# Anki Haptics

Haptics device integration for Anki.

## WARNING

Test the add-on with your devices away from your body first to make sure they do not do anything unexpected. If you run into odd behavior, [report issues here](https://github.com/Kuuuube/ankihaptics/issues).

## Setup

1. Install [Intiface Central](https://intiface.com/central/)

2. Run Intiface Central and start the server by clicking on the top left start button (â–¶). (Optionally, enable `Start Server when Intiface Central Launches` in `App Modes`)

    For further information on setting up and connecting your device to Intiface Central, see the [official documentation](https://docs.intiface.com/docs/intiface-central/quickstart).

3. Install the Anki Haptics addon.

    - Open Anki.

    - On the top menu, go to `Tools` > `Add-ons`.

    - Click `Get Add-ons...`.

    - Input `247550864`

    - Click `OK`.

    - Restart Anki

4. Start Anki. If Anki was already started, go to `Tools` > `Anki Haptics Settings` and click `Reconnect`.

5. In `Tools` > `Anki Haptics Settings`, enable your device and configure your settings.

## Usage

All actions can be configured individually in settings.

## Settings Values

### General

- `Device Enabled` Whether or not the device should be sent commands such as vibration.

- `Enabled Pattern` Checks whether a command can be sent on the current card. `*` matches all cards. Uses the same format as [Anki's Browser Searching](https://docs.ankiweb.net/searching.html).

- `Actuators` These will show up as checkboxes such as `Vibrate`. Check or uncheck them to enable or disable triggering these features on your device.

    Only scalar device features are supported. This includes any feature that can be addressed by a single 0-100% value.

### Anki Actions

- `Again Button` Checks whether a command can be sent when pressing the again button.

    - `Strength` Strength to activate at when pressing the again button.

- `Hard Button` Checks whether a command can be sent when pressing the hard button.

    - `Strength` Strength to activate at when pressing the hard button.

- `Good Button` Checks whether a command can be sent when pressing the good button.

    - `Strength` Strength to activate at when pressing the good button.

### Duration

Durations apply to all connected devices.

- `Again Button` Duration in seconds to activate for when pressing the again button.

- `Hard Button` Duration in seconds to activate for when pressing the hard button.

- `Good Button` Duration in seconds to activate for when pressing the good button.

- `Easy Button` Duration in seconds to activate for when pressing the easy button.

## Config Values

For advanced users only. Accessible through `Tools` > `Add-ons` > `Anki Haptics` > `Config`. Restarting Anki is recommended after changing config values.

The config can also be used to fine-tune settings values.

- `websocket_path` The websocket path configured in Intiface Central.

- `reconnect_delay` The delay in seconds to wait when reconnecting to Intiface central.

- `websocket_polling_delay_ms` The delay in milliseconds to wait before the websocket thread polls for commands again. Increases or decreases latency when Anki actions occur. Increase this value if you notice Anki's CPU usage spikes after installing this add-on.

## Troubleshooting

### Scanning can't find device

Sometimes, requesting to scan for a device through Anki Haptics doesn't work.

Connect your device through scanning in Intiface directly instead and Anki Haptics will find it without needing to scan.

(You may need to restart Intiface if it has already failed once through Anki Haptics)

### Something broke!

First, try restarting Anki and see if that fixes it.

Second, reset your settings to default (`Tools` > `Add-ons` > `Anki Haptics` > `Config` > `Restore Defaults`) and restart Anki.

If neither of those helped, please [report an issue here](https://github.com/Kuuuube/ankihaptics/issues).
